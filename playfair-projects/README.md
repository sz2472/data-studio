# Playfair Projects

This is where we'll be organizing our pitching/writing/etc process for all of the [Lede Program's](http://ledeprogram.com) Playfair projects.
  
## Introduction

Playfair is a way for both current and previous students to stay on top of analysis, visualization, and all the arcane corners of data. Our goals are:

* **Create quality portfolio pieces** through a process that involves feedback and editorial oversight.
* **Give and receive feedback** to make our projects collectively better, along with making sure we're functional members of society.
* **Create documentation of our processes** so that others can learn from what we've created (and the really intense can reproduce and check our work)

Sounds good?

## The Pitching/Submitting Process

You can read detailed instructions in [PITCHING.md](PITCHING.md) and [SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md), but a summary is below.

1. [Submit a pitch](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1) with [Pitch] in the issue title.
2. [Get some feedback](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234377726) and [respond to that feedback](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234379100).
3. You'll then get [editorial feedback and hopefully approval](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/1#issuecomment-234380193).
4. [Create a story issue](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2).
5. [Post updates](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234383998) and [get feedback](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384424) and [post more updates](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384733)
6. When you're done with your content, [send a pull request](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384971) that **includes your story issue number** mine was #2
7. If everything looks good, your pull request will be approved and the [story issue closed](https://github.com/jsoma/playfair-projects/issues/2#issuecomment-234384994)

You must submit and complete a checklist as the first step to pitching/story submission/pull request-ing.

* [Pitch issue checklist](checklist-pitch.md)
* [Story issue checklist](checklist-story.md)
* [Pull request checklist](checklist-pr.md)

## Story submission format

You can read detailed instructions in [SUBMISSION.md](SUBMISSION.md). After you fork the repository, create your directories and complete your story, be sure to include the following in your pull request.

* a [correctly-formatted](SUBMISSION.md#storymd-format) `STORY.md` file
* `README.md`, summary of how you did your project
* `DIARY.md`, a disorganized mess keeping track of your process
* any images or code you used in the process of writing your story/building your visual
