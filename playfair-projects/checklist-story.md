# Story issue checklist

After you create a story issue, **cut and paste the following as the first comment** (but be sure to fill in the story title and pitch issue before you add the comment).

After the comment has been submitted, you'll be able to use the checkboxes interactively. When all the boxes are checked, you'll be able to send in a pull request.
