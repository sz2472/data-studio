I was inspired by the fivethirtyeight piece named "Which countries' terrorist attacks are ignored by the U.S. media?"
"The death toll in the West tends to be lower most of the time, but the coverage the West gets is an order of magnitude larger. So I began to want to know more about terrorism attacks happen at other places of world other than West Europe. So I kept looking at news and found an article "Is terrorism in Europe at a historical high? in which the author articulated a similar idea: With the recent attacks on Paris, Brussels and Nice, our perspective on the threat of terrorism looming large in West Europe may be skewed: the data shows this isn't actually the deadliest spate of terrorist attacks the region has seen. So I wanted to make a graph about deadly terrorism attacks happened other than Western Europe.

The data source I used is Global Terrorism Database(GTD) and I used advance search to generate the csv file I wanted to analyze.
